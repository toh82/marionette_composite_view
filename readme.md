nested collections/models and views
============================

This is an simple example how to deal with nested collections/models in backbonejs with marionettjs composite views. A composite views, 
as described in the [marionettejs docs](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.compositeview.md), is a view to handle both, a model itemview and a collectionview.
So it's a very elegant solution to get rid of some unwanted view files in you view folder and have more control.
